# Classify LIGO data

Repository associated with my Master's thesis, entitled "Deep Learning for the Classification 
of Transient Noise and Signals from the LIGO Detectors".

The main goal is to successfully separate the 22 classes of the Gravity Spy dataset.
The models trained on the dataset are also evaluated with real gravitational wave events.

The main architectures which are used are Convolutional Neural Networks, 
especially from the ResNet and ConvNeXt families.
